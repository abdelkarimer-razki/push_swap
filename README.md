# push_swap
First of all, we have to explain what this project actually ask us to do.
Well, we have basiclly two stacks, the first is named 'STACK A' and the second is 'STACK B',

are does instructions that we have to use in order to sort our stack.

Before i even got to start this project i had to make a full review on all the sorting algorithms i possibly could found so i would find it easy to sort my stack.
